			  <h3>Who I am&nbsp;</h3>
			  <p>My name is Richard Morrey and I am a Software Development professsional from Oxfordshire, UK, with
			     25 years experience. I am not in any way eminent but I am competent.</p>
			  <p>I created this site and associated resouces because I wanted to do justice to what I still think is a 
			  	good idea. I have no financial or business motivation or goals. All of this was done in my spare
			  	time and (don't laugh) for the "public good".</p>
			  <p>I would be delighted with any interest or feedback from anyone, positive or negative. If you have some
			     killer reason why FLAP can't work please drop a quick line to tell me so I can get back to Twitter. If
			     you have software development skills and are interested in helping with a full scale open source implementation
			     I would be delighted to hear from you. There is a lot more that could be done.</p>

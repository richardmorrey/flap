			  <p>My name is Richard Morrey and I am a Software Development professsional from Oxfordshire, UK, with
			     over 25 years experience. I am not in any way eminent but I am competent.</p>
			  <p>I created this site and associated resouces because I want to do justice to what I still think is a 
			  	good idea. I have no financial or business motivation or goals. All of this was done in my spare
			  	time and (don't laugh) for the "public good".</p>
			  <p>I am under no illusions of the chances of this idea getting any traction. I would be delighted with
			  	any interest or feedback from anyone, positive or negative. If you have some killer reason
				why FLAP can't work please drop me a quick line to tell me why I can get on with the rest of my life.</p>

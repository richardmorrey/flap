			<h3>Clearance Promises&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>With the basic implementation of FLAP as largely discussed on this site and as currently modelled, there is no means for
			   a Traveller to be sure, on completion of one trip, when they will be allowed to start the next. This is because the amount
				credited to each "grounded" Traveller, that is each Traveller with a distance balance in deficit, varies over time
				according to the size of the Daily Total and the number of grounded Travellers.  
			</p>
			<p>"Clearance Promises" are a simple extension to provide such certainty. They enable Travellers (in practice more likely
				airlines on behalf of Travellers), to submit flight details for a trip to FLAP at the point when they are booked
				rather than at check-in. In return FLAP creates a "Clearance Promise" for the Traveller: a fixed date after the 
				completion of the trip when the Traveller will be allowed to fly again, regardless of their distance balance.
			</p>

			<h3>In Practice&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>With Clearance Promises in place most Travellers will be entirely insulated from the details of how FLAP works. 
				Their experience will instead simply of a calendar, very similar to a calendar presented
				on-line for the booking of holiday accomodation, with each day colour coded according to its currrent FLAP
				state. Below is a mock-up from of how this might look using Google Calendar.

			Here the blue days show a return trip from London to Rome for a long weekend over the New Year. Immediately after the red
			days show when the Traveller is grounded and unable to travel. More trips can be booked only if the days taken for the trip to 			       complete and their Clearance Promise date to be reached are clear.
			<h3>Implementation&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>The key to Clearance Promises is the devising of an algorithm that calculates accurate clearance dates - dates
				that are on average consistent with when the distance balance returns to credit. This will be a core goal
				of the next iteration of the FLAP implementation.

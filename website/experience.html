			<h3>Trips</h3>
			As far as FLAP is concerned a Trip is simply a sequence of consecutive flights by a single Traveller with a maximum length
			of 1 year from the start of the first flight to the end of the last. Trips improve usability in the following ways:
			<ul>
			<li>Travellers who are part way through a Trip can not be "grounded" - prevented from checking in.
			</li>
			<li>FLAP automatically enforces the start of a Trip and the end of a Trip following the most common pattern - a return trip 
			       made up of an outward journey of one or more flights followed by an inward journey of one or more flights. Thus
			       all Travellers taking journeys of this type are automatically protected against being stranded.
			</li>
			<li>FLAP allows Travellers to close and reopen (lengthen) their own Trips. This means they can manage edge-case mid-trip
				scenarios such as health emergencies and extreme travel disruption to avoid being stranded. It also enables them to
				take an arbitrary seqeuence of up to 50 flights within a one year period, regardless of their distance
				balance, by keeping the FLAP Trip open.	
			</li>
			</ul>
			Note that this flexibility does not affect the effectiveness of the system because Trips have to end, when the limits
			of 50 flights or 1 year are reached, and at that point the Traveller has to wait for their balance to return to credit
			before they can fly again.
			<h3>Clearance Promises</h3>
			<p>Even with this flexible approach to Trips a significant issue with FLAP usability remains. There is no means for
			   a Traveller to be sure, on completion of one Trip, when they will be allowed to start the next. This is because the amount
				credited to each "grounded" Traveller, that is each Traveller with a distance balance in deficit, varies over time
				according to the size of the Daily Total and the number of grounded Travellers.  
			</p>
			<p>"Clearance Promises" are a simple extension to provide such certainty. They enable Travellers (in practice more likely
				airlines on behalf of Travellers), to submit flight details for a trip to FLAP at the point when they are booked
				rather than at check-in. In return FLAP creates a "Clearance Promise" for the Traveller: a fixed date after the 
				completion of the trip when the Traveller will be allowed to fly again, regardless of their distance balance.
			</p>

			<h3>In Practice</h3>
			<p>With Clearance Promises in place most Travellers will be entirely insulated from the details of how FLAP works. 
				Their experience will instead simply of a calendar, very similar to a calendar presented
				on-line for the booking of holiday accomodation, with each day colour coded according to its currrent FLAP
				state. Below is a mock-up from of how this might look using Google Calendar.
			</p>

				<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23ffffff&amp;ctz=Europe%2FLondon&amp;src=Nm11ajdhOWdzaXFkbzBlZmZjMzNybG1ma2tAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&amp;src=NW1sYzZzdWxuMXB0aG9sdjRmZGcxNDJvczRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&amp;color=%235A6986&amp;color=%23711616&amp;showTitle=0&amp;showNav=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;dates=20210101/20210131" style="border-width:0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>The blue days show a return trip from London to Rome for a long weekend over the New Year. Immediately after the red
			days show when the Traveller is grounded and unable to travel. As soon as the Clearance Promise date (4th February) is reached
			the  days turn clear again.</p>
		        <p>The Traveller is free to book more trips but only where the days taken for the trip itself and for the associated Clearance
			Promise date to be reached are all clear.</p>
			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<p>The key to Clearance Promises is the devising of an algorithm that calculates accurate clearance dates - dates
				that are on average consistent with when the distance balance returns to credit. This will be a core goal
				of the next iteration of the FLAP implementation.

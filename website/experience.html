			<h4>Clearance Promises</h4>
			<p>With the basic implementation of FLAP as largely discussed on this site and as currently modelled, there is no means of
				of being sure, om completion of one trip, when you will be allowed to start the next. This is because the amount
				credited to each "grounded" Traveller, that is each Traveller with a distance balance in deficit, varies over time
				according to the size of the Daily Total and the number of grounded Travellers.  
			</p>
			<p>"Clearance Promises" are a simple extension to provide such certainty. They enable Travellers (in practice more likely
				air lines on behalf of Travellers), to submit flight details for a trip to FLAP at the point when they are booked
				rather than at check-in. In return FLAP creates a "Clearance Promise" for the Traveller: a fixed date after the 
				completion of the trip when the Traveller can fly again, regardless of their distance balance.
			</p>

			<p>The key to Clearance Promises is the devising of an algorithm that calculates accurate clearance dates - dates
				that are on average consistent with when the distance balance returns to credit. This will be a core goal
				of the next iteration of the implementation.
			</p>
			
			<h4>In Practice</h4>
			<p>With Clearance Promises in place most Travellers will be entirely insulated from the details of how FLAP works. 
				Their experience will experience instead will simply be via a calendar, very similar to a calendar presented
				on-line for the booking of holiday accomodation, with each day colour coded according to its currrent FLAP
				state:
					<li>Travelling - on a trip</li>
					<li>Cleared -  free to travel</li>
					<li>Grounded - not allowed to travel</li>
				Below is a mock-up from of how this might look using Google Calendar.

			<h4>So what is this all about then?</h4>
			<p>It is all about FLAP, a non-judgemental system/scheme for reducing global air travel to help save the planet.</p>
			<h4>Do we really need to reduce air travel? I've heard it only accounts for 2% of global emissions after all.
			    Surely carbon-offsetting, biofuels and electric planes will save us?</h4>
			<p>Sadly not. Take a look at Figures 8.1 (p606) and 8.3 (p608) in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf">ICC 2018 Report Chapter 8</a> to get a better idea of air travel's significant and rapidly increasing contribution to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  
		       	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/heathrow-expansion-mockery-zero
			-emissions"> This short article</a> by United Kingdom Green Party MP Caroline Lucas explains why reduction is
			the only option. Finally
			<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/04/travel-and-transport-biofuels">this article</a>,
			by George Monbiot, also short, explains why biofuels in particular are such a very bad idea.</p>
			<h4>Blimey I haven't got time to read all that stuff. Just tell me about FLAP so I can get on with my day.</h4>
			<p>Sure. It is pretty simple really - a scheme/on-line computer system for directly managing the total distance travelled by
			air each day. It works as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Every time someone (a "Traveller") checks in for a flight the airline reports the details of the flight to FLAP.
				       	Airlines are legally obliged to do this.</li>
				<li>FLAP maintains a "distance account", similar to a bank account, for every Traveller, with a balance of distance
					travelled by air.</li>
				<li>Every time a flight check-in is reported FLAP debits the distance of that flight from the Traveller's balance.</li>
				<li>A single value, the "Daily Total", specifies the total distance that can be travelled by air each day.</li>
				<li>Each day FLAP credits all distance accounts in deficit with an equal share of the Daily Total.</li>
				<li>If a Traveller attempts to start a new trip when in a negative balance FLAP instructs the airline to
					refuse the check-in. Airlines are legally obliged to do this.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<h4>Is that it? My &lt;insert-single-digit-number-here&gt; year old could have come up with that.</h4>
			<p>It was much more complicated to begin with. I kept removing bits until it didn't work any
			more and then reinstated the last bit I removed. In other words I put a lot of effort into getting it that simple.</p>
			<h4>Oh dear. I think you may have been wasting your time. You said FLAP is "non-judgemental". What do you mean by that?</h4>
			<p>I mean that it does not systematically judge or penalize frequent flyers. Rather it objectively and directly targets 
			the core issue - reducing global air travel to a level that is environmentally sustainable. This manifests in three key ways:
			<ul>
				<li>No financial penalty or incentive is involved - a key benefit over frequent flyer tax schemes
					like <a href="http://afreeride.org/">A Free Ride</a></li>
				<li>All travellers adhere to the same rules regardless of how often they travel.</li>
				<li>Variation in the distance each person travelled is allowed, unlike in a traditional rationing scheme.</li> 
			</ul></p>
			<h4>All I see is a few bullet points in a dull colour scheme. How can you be so sure how it would pan out in practice?</h4>
			<p>Because I "wasted" more of my time implementing it, implementing a global air traffic model to exercise it, and
				analysing the results. The system and model code are <a href="https://github.com/richardmorrey/flap">
				available on Github</a>. Go to <a href="./modelling.html">Modelling</a> for a summary of the findings.
			<h4>Hang on minute. I have to fly frequently for my work and family reasons and &lt;insert-arbitrary-justification-here&gt;.
				These results prove your scheme is unfairly targetting people like me.</h4>
			<p>I completely accept that the personal and professional situation of some mean they feel obliged to fly more often,
				and as discussed and shown, FLAP is pretty accomodating in this respect. However the bottom line is
				<a href="http://afreeride.org/about/">70% of flights are taken by 15% of travellers</a>, so air travel can only be
				signficiantly reduced through a change in behaviour of that 15%. This is not unfair targetting but objective
				fact. Another way of looking at this is that global air travel has tripled in the past twenty years. If you
				returned to the amount of flying you did in 2000, would that really be such a privation?</p>
			<h4>Look stop now. This just won't work. You can't realistically expect airlines to report every single check-in across
				the whole world. Even if you could thousands of people will end up stranded in airports far from
				home. And how on earth can I make firm travel plans when I could be turned away at check-in at any point.
				And what about blah, and blah, and blah blah blah?</h4>
			<p>Well I "wasted" even more of my time writing <a href="./doc/flapwhitepaper.pdf">this white paper</a> considering these
				and many other aspects, which you are welcome to read, but specifically:
				<ul>
					<li>I know airlines can report all check-ins back to a central system
						because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Passenger_Information_System">
						they are already doing it.</a></li>
					<li>FLAP only refuses check-ins at the start of a "Trip", and its definition of what constitutes a Trip
					 	is extremely flexible. Someone would have to stretch this definition to its extreme limit to be
						at any risk of becoming stranded.	
					</li>
					<li>Yes there clearly needs to be more certainty for the traveller to make this a practical scheme. For
						this reason I am currently implementing new feature, based on the ideas discussed in 5.2 of the
						white paper, called "Clearance Promises", which will make FLAP much easier to use. See
						<a href="./experience.html">here</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h4>My you have been busy. But really, you're focussing on the wrong thing here. Figure 8.1 clearly shows road
				travel is a far bigger problem that air travel.</h4>
			<p>They are both a problem, but yes you are right. We desperately need a practical plan for reducing road travel too.
				I believe that the principles guiding FLAP can be applied, but it is a bit trickier. If someone (anyone!)
				shows some interest I may have a go at coming up with something.</p>

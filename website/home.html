			<h3>So what is this all about then?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>It is all about FLAP, a non-judgemental system/scheme for reducing global air travel to help save the planet.</p>
			<h3>Do we really need to reduce air travel? I've heard it only accounts for 2% of global emissions after all.
			    Surely carbon-offsetting, biofuels and electric planes will save us?</h3>
			<p>Sadly not. Take a look at Figures 8.1 (p606) and 8.3 (p608) in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf">ICC 2018 Report Chapter 8</a> to get a better idea of air travel's significant and rapidly increasing contribution to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  
		       	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/heathrow-expansion-mockery-zero
			-emissions"> This short article</a> by United Kingdom Green Party MP Caroline Lucas explains why reduction is
			the only viable solution. 
			<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/04/travel-and-transport-biofuels">This article</a>
			by George Monbiot, also short, explains why biofuels in particular are such a very bad idea.</p>
			<h3>Blimey I haven't got time to read all that stuff. Just tell me about FLAP so I can get on with my day.&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Sure. It is a scheme and computer system for directly managing the total distance travelled by
			air each day. It works as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Every time someone (a "Traveller") checks in for a flight the airline reports the details of the flight to FLAP.
				       	Airlines are legally obliged to do this.</li>
				<li>FLAP maintains a "distance account", similar to a bank account, for every Traveller, with a balance of distance
					travelled by air.</li>
				<li>Every time a flight check-in is reported FLAP debits the distance of that flight from the Traveller's balance.</li>
				<li>A single value, the "Daily Total", specifies the total distance that can be travelled by air each day.</li>
				<li>Each day FLAP credits all distance accounts in deficit with an equal share of the Daily Total.</li>
				<li>If a Traveller with a negative distance balance attempts to start a new trip FLAP instructs the airline to
					refuse the check-in. Airlines are legally obliged to comply.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<h3>Is that it? My &lt;insert-single-digit-number-here&gt; year old could have come up with that.&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>It was much more complicated to begin with. I kept removing bits until it didn't work any
			more and then reinstated the last bit I removed. In other words I put a lot of effort into getting it that simple.</p>
			<h3>Oh dear. I think you may have been wasting your time. You said FLAP is "non-judgemental". What do you mean by that?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>I mean that it does not systematically judge or penalize frequent flyers. Rather it directly and exclusively targets 
			the core issue - reducing global air travel to a level that is environmentally sustainable. This manifests in three key ways:
			<ul>
				<li>No financial penalty or incentive is involved - a key benefit over frequent flyer tax schemes
					like <a href="http://afreeride.org/">A Free Ride</a></li>
				<li>All travellers adhere to the same rules regardless of how often they travel.</li>
				<li>Enables continuing variation in the distance each person is able to travell</li> 
			</ul></p>
			<h3>Well all I see is a few bullet points in a dull colour scheme. How can you be so sure how this thing would pan out in practice?</h3>
			<p>Because I have wasted more of my time implementing it, implementing a global air traffic model to exercise it, and
				analysing the results. The system and model code are <a href="https://github.com/richardmorrey/flap">
				available on Github</a>. Go to <a href="./modelling.html">Modelling</a> for a summary of the findings.
			<h3>Hang on minute. I have to fly frequently for my work and family reasons and &lt;insert-arbitrary-justification-here&gt;.
				These results prove your scheme is unfairly targetting people like me.&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>The personal and professional situation of some mean they feel obliged to fly more often, and I hope you can see that
			the FLAP rules don't target any particular category of traveller. However the fact is
			   <a href="http://afreeride.org/about/">70% of flights are taken by 15% of travellers</a>, meaning air travel can only be
			   signficiantly reduced through a change in behaviour of that 15%. This is not unfair targetting but basic arithmetic.</p>
			<h3>Look stop now. This just won't work. You can't realistically expect airlines to report every single check-in across
				the whole world. Even if you could thousands of people will end up stranded in airports far from
				home. And how on earth can I make firm travel plans when I could be turned away at check-in at any point.
				And what about blah, and blah, and blah blah blah?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Well I wasted even more of my time writing <a href="./doc/flapwhitepaper.pdf">this white paper</a> considering these
				and many other aspects, which you are welcome to read, but specifically:
				<ul>
					<li>I know airlines can report all check-ins back to a central system
						because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Passenger_Information_System">
						they are already doing it!</a></li>
					<li>FLAP only refuses check-ins at the start of a "Trip", and its definition of what constitutes a Trip
					 	is flexible. Someone would have to push this definition to its extreme limit before being
						at any risk of becoming stranded.	
					</li>
					<li>Yes there clearly needs to be more certainty for the traveller to make this a practical scheme. For
						this reason I am currently implementing a new feature, based on the ideas discussed in 5.2 of the
						white paper, called "Clearance Promises", which will make FLAP much easier to use. See
						<a href="./experience.html">here</a> for details.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>My you have been busy. But really, you're focussing on the wrong thing here. Figure 8.1 clearly shows road
				travel is a far bigger problem that air travel.&nbsp</h3>
			<p>They are both a problem, but yes you are right. We desperately need a practical plan for reducing road travel too.
				I believe that the principles guiding FLAP can be applied, but it is a bit trickier. If someone (anyone!)
				shows some interest I may have a go at coming up with something.</p>

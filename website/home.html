			<h3>So what is this all about then?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>It is all about FLAP, a non-judgemental system/scheme for reducing global air travel to help save the planet.</p>
			<h3>Do we really need to reduce air travel? I've heard it only accounts for 2% of global emissions after all.
			    Surely carbon-offsetting, biofuels and electric planes will save us?</h3>
			<p>Sadly not. Take a look at Figures 8.1 (p606) and 8.3 (p608) in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf">ICC 2018 Report Chapter 8</a> to get a better idea of air travel's significant and rapidly increasing contribution to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  
		       	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/heathrow-expansion-mockery-zero
			-emissions"> This short article</a> by United Kingdom Green Party MP Caroline Lucas explains why reduction is
			the only viable solution. 
			<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/04/travel-and-transport-biofuels">This article</a>
			by George Monbiot, also short, explains why biofuels in particular are such a very bad idea.</p>
			<h3>Blimey I haven't got time to read all that stuff. Just tell me about FLAP so I can get on with my day.&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Sure. It is a scheme and computer system for directly managing the total distance travelled by
			air each day. It works as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Every time someone (a "Traveller") checks in for a flight the airline reports the details of the flight to FLAP.
				       	Airlines are legally obliged to do this.</li>
				<li>FLAP uses this information to maintain a "distance account", similar to a bank account but of distance rather
					than money, for every Traveller. The distance of every flight taken is withdrawn from the
					relevant account.</li>
				<li>A single value, the "Daily Total", specifies the total distance that can be travelled by air daily.</li>
				<li>At the end of each day FLAP credits all distance accounts in deficit with an equal share of the Daily Total.</li>
				<li>If a Traveller with a negative distance balance attempts to start a new trip FLAP instructs the airline to
					refuse the check-in. Airlines are legally obliged to comply.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<h3>Is that it? My &lt;insert-single-digit-number-here&gt; year old could have come up with that.&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>It was much more complicated to begin with. I kept removing bits until it didn't work any
			more and then reinstated the last bit I removed. In other words I put a lot of effort into getting it that simple.</p>
			<h3>Oh dear. I think you may have been wasting your time. You said FLAP is "non-judgemental". What do you mean by that?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>I mean that FLAP does not aim to judge, stigmatise or penalise those who fly. Instead it aims to engage
			positively with them to achieve the necessary goal of reducing air travel. Most significantly:
			<ul>
				<li>No financial penalty or incentive is involved - a key benefit over frequent flyer tax schemes
					like <a href="http://afreeride.org/">A Free Ride</a>.</li>
				<li>Everyone adheres to the same rules regardless of how often they fly.</li>
				<li>No restriction is placed on the amount any one person can fly.</li> 
			</ul></p>
			<h3>Well all I see is a few bullet points in a dull colour scheme. How can you be so sure how this thing would pan out in practice?</h3>
			<p>Because I have wasted more of my time implementing it, implementing a global air traffic model to exercise it, and
				analysing the results. The system and model code are <a href="https://github.com/richardmorrey/flap">
				available on Github</a>. Go to <a href="./modelling.html">Modelling</a> for a summary of the findings.
			<h3>Hang on minute. I have to fly frequently for my work and family reasons.
				These results prove your scheme is unfairly targetting people like me.&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>As I have explained FLAP is non-judgemental and does not target any particular category of traveller. However the fact is
			   <a href="http://afreeride.org/about/">70% of flights are taken by 15% of travellers</a>, meaning air travel can only be
			   signficiantly reduced through a change in behaviour of that 15%. This is not unfair targetting but basic arithmetic.</p>
			<h3>Look stop now. This just won't work. You can't realistically expect airlines to report every single check-in across
				the whole world. Even if you could thousands of people will end up stranded in airports far from
				home. And how on earth can I make firm travel plans when I could be turned away at check-in at any point.
				And what about blah, and blah, and blah blah blah?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Well I wasted even more of my time writing <a href="./doc/flapwhitepaper.pdf">this white paper</a> considering these
				and many other aspects, which you are welcome to read, but specifically:
				<ul>
					<li>I know airlines can report all check-ins back to a central system
						because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Passenger_Information_System">
						they are already doing it!</a></li>
					<li>FLAP only refuses check-ins at the start of a "Trip", and its definition of what constitutes a Trip
					 	is flexible. Someone would have to push this definition to its extreme limit before being
						at any risk of becoming stranded.	
					</li>
					<li>Yes there clearly needs to be more certainty for the traveller to make this a practical scheme. For
						this reason I am currently implementing a new feature, based on the ideas discussed in 5.2 of the
						white paper, called "Clearance Promises", which will make FLAP much easier to use. See
						<a href="./experience.html">here</a> for details.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>My you have been busy. But really, you're focussing on the wrong thing here. Figure 8.1 clearly shows road
				travel is a far bigger problem that air travel.&nbsp</h3>
			<p>They are both a problem, but yes you are right. We desperately need a practical plan for reducing road travel too.
				I believe that the principles guiding FLAP can be applied, but it is a bit trickier. If someone (anyone!)
				shows some interest I may have a go at coming up with something.</p>

			<h3>So what is this all about then?</h3>
			<p>It is all about FLAP, a non-judgemental system/scheme for reducing global air travel to help save the planet</p>
			<h3>Do we really need to reduce air travel? I've heard it only accounts for 2% of global emissiones after all.
			    Surely carbon-offsetting/biofuels/electric planes will save us?</h3>
			<p>Sadly not no. Take a look at Figures 8.1 (p606) and 8.3 (p608) in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf">ICC 2018 Report Chapter 8</a> to get a better idea of air travel's significant and, critically, increasing contribution to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  
		       	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/heathrow-expansion-mockery-zero
			-emissions"> This short article</a> by United Kingdom Green Party MP Caroline Lucas explains the reasons
			why air travel reduction is the only way to address this in time. Finally
			<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/04/travel-and-transport-biofuels">this article</a>,
			by George Monbiot, also short, explains why biofuels in particular are such a very bad idea.</p>
			<h3>Blimey I havent got time to read all that stuff. Just tell me about FLAP so I can get on with my day</h3>
			<p>Sure. It is pretty simple really - a scheme/on-line computer system for directly managing the total distance travelled by
			air each day. It works as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Every time someone checks in for a flight the airline reports the details of the flight to FLAP. Airlines are
					legally obliged to do this.</li>
				<li>FLAP maintains a "distance account", similar to a bank account, for every travller, with a balance of distance
					travlled by air.</li>
				<li>Every time a flight check-in is reported FLAP debits the distance of that flight from the traveller's balance.</li>
				<li>A single value, the Daily Total, specifies the total distance that can be travelled by air each day.</li>
				<li>Each day FLAP credits all distance accounts in deficit with an equal share of the Daily Total.</li>
				<li>If a traveller attempts to start a new trip when in a negative balance FLAP instructs the airline to
					refuse the check-in.Airlines are legally obliged to do this.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<h3>Is that it? My &lt;insert single digit number here &gt;-year-old could have come up with that.</h3>
			<p>Yes I like things simple. FLAP started off much more complicated. I kept removing bits until it didn't work any
			more and then reinstated the last bit I removed. In other words I put a lot of effort into getting it that simple.</p>
			<h3>Well, sorry to have to break this to you, but I think you have been wasting your time. You said FLAP is
			"non-judgemental". What do you mean by that?<h3>

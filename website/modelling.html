			<h3>Overview&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Following is a summary of the findings of a modelling exercise simulating 2000 days of 
			global air traffic by 1 million travellers. These 1 million travellers were split into two
			bands to repesent the real-world balance between frequent and infrequent flyers discussed
			<a href="http://afreeride.org/">here</a> and
			<a href="https://www.inequalityintransport.org.uk/exploring-transport-inequality/who-travels-air">here</a>:
			<ul>
				<li>150,000 frequent flyers, making on average one trip every 100 days</li>
				<li>850,000 infrequent flyers, making on average one trip every 500 days</li> 	
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			The initial "Daily Total" was calcualted as the average total daily distance travelled during the first 100 days.
			This was then enforced, and reduced by 0.05% each day, from Day 101 onwards.
			</p>
			<p>The source code for the FLAP implementation and modelling tooli used is available
				<a href="https://github.com/richardmorrey/flap">here</a>to download and use.</p>
			<h3>Global air travel is reduced</h3>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal1chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how the Daily Total and the total daily distance travelled varies over time. Air travel is
			halved over the course of 5 years. You can see a visualization of flights contribution to each data point on this graph
			<a href="./explore.html">here.</a>

			<h3>Frequent flyers can still fly more</h3>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal2chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how the average distance travelled every 100 days by frequent and infrequent travellers compares over
			time. Frequent traveller flying is reduced whilst infrequent traveller flying remains steady, but
			despite this frequent flyers fly more throughout the 2000 day period.
			<h3>Infrequent flyers are impacted less</h3>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal3chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows the percentage of trips that are rejected by FLAP for frequent and infrequent travellers.
			Infrequent flyers suffer far less disruption to their travel plans than frequent flyers.
			<h3>Opportunities for improvement</h3>
			The model used to generate these results is basic. Whilst it does simulate global air traffic on geniune routes between
			genuine airports it diverges from real-world flying patterns in many ways, including:
			<ul>
				<li>All trips simulated are simple return flights.</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to simulate seasonal variations in flying patterns.</li>
				<li>Each simulated traveller has a home country but no home location within that country to influence choice of departure location.</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to simulate variation in passport details due to lost or stolen passports and dual passport holders.</li>
				<li>No attempt to simulate changes in traveller behaviour over time</li>
			</ul>
			I don't believe any of these negate the findings on this page but nevertheless I plan to address some in future iterations of
		       the modelling tool. I am also planning s second white paper focussed on the details of the modelling process and its results.

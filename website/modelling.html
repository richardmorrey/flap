			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Following is the story, in three graphs, of a modelling process in which FLAP was exercised with 2000 days of realistic
			global traffic by 1 million travellers. For simplicity these 1 million travellers were split into two bands:
			<ul>
				<li>100,000 frequent flyers, making on average TBD trips a year</li>
				<li>900,000 infrequent flyers, making on average TBD trips a year</li> 	
			</ul>
			The first 100 days of the simulation were run in "log-only mode", with the average total daily distance travelled during
			this period being taken as the initial Daily Total for Day 101. From Day 102 onwards the Daily Total is reduced by 0.1% 
			each day.
			<br><br>Brief summary: it works!
			<h2>Goal 1 -  Reduce global air travel</h2>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal1chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how the Daily Total and the total daily distance travelled varies over time. It shows that air travel is
			reduced by TBD % over 5 years.
			<h2>Goal 2 -  Frequent flyers can still fly more</h2>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal2chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how the total daily distance travelled by frequent and infrequent travellers compare over time. It shows
			that frequent traveller flying is reduced whilst infrequent traveller flying remains steady, but also that despite this 
			frequent flyers are still travelling significantly more than infrequent flyers at the end of the 5 year period.
			<h2>Goal 3- Minimum disruption for infrequent flyers</h2>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal3chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how many check-ins are rejected by FLAP on average for frequent and infrequent travellers. It shows that
			that frequent flyers are significantly impacted whilst infrequent flyers are not.
			<h2>Caveats and areas for improvement</h2>
			The model used is basic and, whilst it does simulate global air traffic on geniune routes between genuine airports it differs
			from real-world flighing behaviour in many ways, including:
			<ul>
				<li>All trips simulated are simple return flights.</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to simulate seasonal variations in flying patterns.</li>
				<li>Each simulated traveller has a home country but no home location within that country to influence choice of departure location.</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to simulate variation in passport details due to lost or stolen passports and dual passport holders.</li>
				<li>No attempt to simulate changes in traveller behaviour over time</li>
			</ul>
			I don't believe any of these negate the findings on this page but nevertheless some will be addressed in future iterations. 
			A second white paper providing more detail on the modelling process and its results is also planned.

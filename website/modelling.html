			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Following is the story, in three graphs, of a modelling process in which FLAP was exercised with 2000 days of realistic
			global traffic by 1 million travellers. For simplicity these 1 million travellers were split into two bands:
			<ul>
				<li>100,000 frequent flyers, making on average TBD trips a year</li>
				<li>900,000 infrequent flyers, making on average TBD trips a year</li> 	
			</ul>
			The first 100 days of the simulation were run in "log-only mode", with the average total daily distance travelled during
			this period being taken as the initial Daily Total for Day 101. From Day 102 onwards the Daily Total is reduced by 0.1% 
			each day.
			<br>Brief summary: it works.
			<h2>Goal 1. Reducing global air travel</h2>

			<h2>Goal 2. Frequent flyers flying able to fly more than infrequent flyers </h2>

			<h2>Goal 3. Infrequent flyers suffering minimum disruption </h2>
			
			<h2>Caveats and areas for improvement</h2>

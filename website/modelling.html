			<h3><img src='fp.png'></img>Overview&nbsp;<img src='fp.png'></img></h3>
			<p>Following is the story, in three charts, of the outcome of a modelling exercise simulating 2000 days of 
			global air traffic by 1 million travellers. These 1 million travellers were split into:
			<ul>
				<li>150,000 frequent flyers, making on average one trip every 100 days</li>
				<li>850,000 infrequent flyers, making on average one trip every 500 days</li> 	
			</ul>
			, values that approximate to the balance between frequent and other flyers discussed
			<a href="http://afreeride.org/">here</a> and
			<a href="https://www.inequalityintransport.org.uk/exploring-transport-inequality/who-travels-air">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			The average total daily distance travelled during the first 100 days was taken as the initial "Daily Total", that was
			enforced, and reduced by 0.05% each day, from Day 101 onwards.
			<br><br>Brief summary of outcome: it works!
			</p>
			<h3><img src='fp.png'></img>Global air travel is reduced&nbsp;<img src='fp.png'></img></h3>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal1chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how the Daily Total and the total daily distance travelled varies over time. It shows that air travel is
			halved over the course of 5 years. You can see a visualization of flights contribution to each data point on this graph
			<a href="./explore.html">here.</a>

			<h3><img src='fp.png'></img>Frequent flyers can still fly more&nbsp;<img src='fp.png'></img></h3>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal2chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows how the average distance travelled every 100 days by frequent and infrequent travellers compares over
			time. It shows that frequent traveller flying is reduced whilst infrequent traveller flying remains steady, but also that
			despite this frequent flyers are still travelling significantly more than infrequent flyers at the end of the 5 year period.
			<h3><img src='fp.png'></img>Infrequent flyers are impacted less&nbsp;<img src='fp.png'></img></h3>
			<div id=chart-holder><canvas id="goal3chart"></canvas></div>
			<p>This chart shows the percentage of trips that are rejected by FLAP for frequent and infrequent travellers.
			It shows that that infrequent flyers suffer far less disruption to their travel plans than frequent flyers.
			<h3><img src='fp.png'></img>Caveats and areas for improvement&nbsp;<img src='fp.png'></img></h3>
			The model used is basic and, whilst it does simulate global air traffic on geniune routes between genuine airports it diverges
			from real-world flying patterns in many ways, including:
			<ul>
				<li>All trips simulated are simple return flights.</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to simulate seasonal variations in flying patterns.</li>
				<li>Each simulated traveller has a home country but no home location within that country to influence choice of departure location.</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to simulate variation in passport details due to lost or stolen passports and dual passport holders.</li>
				<li>No attempt to simulate changes in traveller behaviour over time</li>
			</ul>
			I don't believe any of these negate the findings on this page but nevertheless some will be addressed in future iterations of
		       the modelling tool. A second white paper focussed on the details of the modelling process and its results is also planned.
